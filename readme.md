# Simple single page WebRTC streamer website
This project is a simple, self contained, single page website for creeating and initiating a streamer client that works with the [WebRTC Signaling Server](https://github.com/JI-0/WebRTC_SignalingServer).
The page starts communicating with the server on load and immediately starts transmitting a stream as a streamer for anyone connecting to the Signaling server.

## Instructions
The website can either be deployed using Apache, Nginx or any other similar web server. It can also be integrated into a larger project or framework as it only contains HTML, CSS and JS.
